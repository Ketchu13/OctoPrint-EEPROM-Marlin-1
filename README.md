# Installing the release candidate:
:tada: There is a new major version of this plugin available, currently in RC phase.

It would be great if you could test it, directions for install can be found below.

:warning: This is a pre-release version of Marlin EEPROM Editor :warning: 
You should only run this if you are OK with things not working perfectly. I have extensively tested this, but this is what RC phases are for, to pick up on bugs before the wider roll out. **It should not break anything to install it**, it just won't work itself.

Install using the following URL in OctoPrint's plugin manager > get more > ...from URL:
```
https://github.com/cp2004/OctoPrint-EEPROM-Marlin/archive/3.0.0r3.zip
```
Once that is installed (and in OP 1.5.0+) you will be able to select 'release candidate' as the release channel (under 'Software Update'), to get future RC updates automatically:

## Setup

Install manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/cp2004/OctoPrint-EEPROM-Marlin/archive/master.zip



## Firmware requirements

This plugin requires that you have **both** these items in Marlin's `Configuration.h` file:

* `#define EEPROM_CHITCHAT`
* `//#define DISABLE_M503`

In other words, `EEPROM_CHITCHAT` and the M503 command must be enabled - comment out disabling it.
