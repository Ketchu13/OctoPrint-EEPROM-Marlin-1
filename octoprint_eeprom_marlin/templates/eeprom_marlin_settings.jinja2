<h4>EEPROM Marlin Plugin</h4>
<p>This plugin is designed to get, change and save the values in the EEPROM of your Marlin Firmware based Machine.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h3><i class="fas-custom fa-custom-hand-point-right text-warning"></i> The EEPROM editor has moved</h3>
<p>You can now find it in its own little tab in the main web UI. This space will be reserved for the <em>plugin's settings</em> in the future, rather than the actual plugin interface.</p>
